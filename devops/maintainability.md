# Maintainability

The majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but in its ongoing maintenance.

**Operability:** Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.

**Simplicity:** Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing as much complexity as possible.

**Evolvability:** Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future.

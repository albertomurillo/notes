# Idiomatic GO

## Getters

Go doesn't provide automatic support for getters and setters. There's nothing wrong with providing getters and setters yourself, and it's often appropriate to do so, but it's neither idiomatic nor necessary to put Get into the getter's name. If you have a field called `owner` (lower case, unexported), the getter method should be called `Owner` (upper case, exported), not `GetOwner`. The use of upper-case names for export provides the hook to discriminate the field from the method. A setter function, if needed, will likely be called `SetOwner`. Both names read well in practice:

```go
owner := obj.Owner()
if owner != user {
    obj.SetOwner(user)
}
```

## Interface names

Interface names

By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name plus an -er suffix or similar modification to construct an agent noun: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Formatter`, `CloseNotifier` etc.

There are a number of such names and it's productive to honor them and the function names they capture. `Read`, `Write`, `Close`, `Flush`, String and so on have canonical signatures and meanings. To avoid confusion, don't give your method one of those names unless it has the same signature and meaning. Conversely, if your type implements a method with the same meaning as a method on a well-known type, give it the same name and signature; call your string-converter method `String` not `ToString`.

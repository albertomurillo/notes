The following tools allows you to define diagrams with code:

- [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com) - Diagrams lets you draw the cloud system architecture in **Python code**.
- [Mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) - Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that takes Markdown-inspired text definitions and creates diagrams dynamically in the browser.
